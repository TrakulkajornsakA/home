		<em>S</em>neaky's career begins all the way back to the third season of professional League of Legends play. The LCS, or League of Legends
		Championship run by the creators of the game itself, <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games</a>, had just been founded and a rising star had been
		found going by the name Quantic Gaming Sneaky.

		<em>Q</em>uantic Gaming qualified to play in the 2013 LCS Summer Split by defeating Team ComPlexity 3-0. The team was later rebranded to Cloud9 and went on to make 
		one of the most legendary runs of the regular season. After going 25-3 in the regular season, Sneaky, along his other former Quantic Gaming teammates,

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<em>G</em>oing on to the Season 3 League of Legends World Championships, C9 was given a bye to the quarterfinal round, where they faced a powerful Fnatic team
		and lost 2-1 in a very close match.

		<p id="content4"><em>R</em>efreshed and ready for a new season, the Cloud 9 returned to the 2014 NA LCS Spring Split with the same roster. Once again, they 
		dominated the regular season, having a 24-4 record and met Team SoloMid for the 2nd time in the finals. Following the momentum of their previous finals victory,
		they defeated their opponents in another 3-0 fashion.

		<em>C</em>oming back for the 2014 NA LCS Summer Split, Cloud9 finished the regular season with less than average 18-10 record, still placing 1st in the league.
		The team advanced to the finals for the 3rd time in a row to face the returning Team SoloMid. This time however, Sneaky and Cloud9 were unsuccessful in securing
		the championship title in a close 3-2 loss.

		<em>A</em>fter qualifying for the Season 4 World Championship, Sneaky and the team went on a tour around various South-East and South Asian locations. Their group stage was
		in Singapore, where they competed against Team Alliance from Europe, NaJin White Shield from Korea, and KaBuM! e-Sports from Brazil.

		<p id="content5"><em>F</em>ollowing a shaky 13-6 group stage record in the 2015 NA LCS Spring Split, the team advanced to the finals to meet Team SoloMid for a 4th time but lost 
		again 3-1.

		<br/>
		<em>T</em>he next split, Cloud 9 made their first roster change. Mid-laner Hai was to be substituted by European talent Incarnati0n.

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<em>I</em>ncarnati0n had a shaky start, as the team had a 7th place finish, barely avoiding relegations. Worlds was approaching and the only way Cloud 9 could 
		qualify for the event in Europe was through the North American Regional Qualifier. With the points that Cloud 9 recieved last Split for their 2nd place finish,
		they were placed in the bracket for the opportunity to be North America's final seed.

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<em>I</em>n preparation for the braket, Cloud 9 brought back former C9 mid-laner and shot-caller Hai to play in the jungle and replace Meteos. The following 
		bracket run was miraculous. The team reverse sweeped not once, but twice aginst Teams Gravity and Impulse to earn a spot at the 2015 World Championship.

		<p id="content6"><em>D</em>uring the off-season, Cloud 9 aquired some quality roster upgrades going by the names of Rush, to replace Hai in the jungle, and 
		Bunny FuFuu, to share time with Hai in the support role. LemonNation, the original C9 support, was moved to a management position.

		<em>D</em>eciding to change their roster once more for the 2016 NA LCS Summer Split, Cloud 9 picked up Korean talent, Impact, to play in the top lane, replacing

		After placing 2nd in the group stage, alongside two-time World Champion Korean team, SK Telecom T1, Taiwanese team Flash Wolves, and Chinese team IMay, Cloud 9 
		became the only North American team to advance to the quarter-finals.

		<h2 id="seventeen"><em>2017</em></h2>
		<br/>
		<p id="content7"><em>A</em>nother roster swap was made over the 2017 off-season. Contractz, the former jungler for Cloud 9's challenger team, was put on the starting roster
		to fill in Meteos's role. The original jungler for Cloud 9 made a sad departure to Pheonix1, becoming a threat to his former team in their 14-4 2017 NA LCS Spring Split
		run.

		growth, and their results for the rest of the year will be there to show.
